T√çTULO: DOCK OF THE BAY, THE

LETRA:

Sittin' in the morning sun
I'll be sittin' when the evening comes
Watching the ships roll in
Then I watch 'em roll away again
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll a-way
I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time---------------

I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the Frisco Bay
'cause I had nothing to live for
And looks like nothing's gonna come my way
So I'm just sittin'...

Looks like nothing's gonna change
Everything still remains the same
I can't do what them people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same

Sittin' here restin' my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
This two thousand miles I roamed
Just to make this dock my home
