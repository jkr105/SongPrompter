(OUT HERE) ON MY OWN


Sometimes I wonder
Where I've been
Who I am
Do I fit in
Make believin'
Is hard alone
Out here on my own

We're always provin'
Who we are
Always reachin'
For that risin' star
To guide me far
And shine me home
Out here on my own

When I'm down
And feelin' blue
I close my eyes
So I can be with you
Oh, baby
Be strong for me
Baby
Belong to me
Help me through
Help me need you

Until the morning
Sun appears
Making light
Off all my fears
I dry the tears
I've never shown
Out here on my own

But, when I'm down
And feelin' blue
I close my eyes
So I can be with you
Oh, baby
Be strong for me
Baby
Belong to me
Help me through
Help me need you

Sometimes I wonder
Where I've been
Who I am
Do I fit in
I may not win
But I can be strong
Out here on my own
On my own
