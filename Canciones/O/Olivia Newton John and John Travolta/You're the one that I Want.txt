TÍTULO: You’re the one that I want

LETRA:

I got chills they’re multiplyin’… 
And I’m losin’ control
‘Cause the power you’re supplying… 
It’s electrifying!

You better shape up 
‘cause I need a man (I need a man)
And my heart is set on you

You better shape up, 
you better understand (understand)
To my heart I must be true
Nothing left, nothing left for me to do

You’re the one that I want! 
You are the one that I want… You, oo, oo… honey!

You’re the one that I want! 
You are the one that I want… You, oo, oo… honey!
You’re the one that I want! 
You are the one that I want…
You, oo, oo, are what I need… Oh, yes, indeed

If you’re filled with affection… 
you’re too shy to convey
Meditate in my direction… 
Feel you way!

I better shape up 
‘cause you need a man (You need a man)
Who can keep you satisfied
I better shape up, 
if I’m gonna prove (I’m gonna prove)
That you faith is justified
Are you sure? Yes, I’m sure down deep inside

You’re the one that I want! 
You are the one that I want… You, oo, oo… honey!
You’re the one that I want! 

You are the one that I want…
You, oo, oo, are what I need… Oh, yes, indeed
