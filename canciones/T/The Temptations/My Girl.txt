TÍTULO: My girl

LETRA:

I’ve got sunshine… on a cloudy day
And when it’s cold outside… I’ve got the month of May
I guess you say… What can make me feel this way?
My girl… Talkin’ ‘bout my girl (my girl)
I’ve got so much honey… the bees envy me
I’ve got a sweeter song baby… than the birds in the trees
I guess you say… What can make me feel this way?
My girl… Talkin’ ‘bout my girl (my girl)
Hey hey hey… Hey hey hey
I don’t need money… fortune or fame
I’ve got all the riches, baby… one man can claim
I guess you say… What can make me feel this way?
My girl… Talkin’ ‘bout my girl Talkin’ ‘bout my girl
I’ve got sunshine… on a cloudy day with my girl
I’ve even got the month of May with my girl
Talkin’ ‘bout… Talkin’ ‘bout… Talkin’ ‘bout my girl
