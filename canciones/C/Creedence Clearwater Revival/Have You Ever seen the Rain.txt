TÍTULO: Have you ever seen the rain?

LETRA:

Someone told me long ago… 
There’s a calm before the storm
I know! 
And it’s been coming for some time

When it’s over so they say… 
It’ll rain a sunny day
I know! Shinin’ down like water
I want to know… Have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know… Have you ever seen the rain?
Comin’ down on a sunny day

Yesterday and days before… 
Sun is cold and rain is hot
I know! Been that way for all my time

‘Til forever on it goes… 
Through the circle fast and slow
I know! And I can’t stop, I wonder
I want to know… Have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know… Have you ever seen the rain?
Comin’ down on a sunny day

I want to know… Have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know… Have you ever seen the rain?
Comin’ down on a sunny day
