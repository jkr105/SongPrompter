TAKE ME HOME - COUNTRY ROADS


Almost heaven
West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains
Shenandoah River

Life is old there
Older than the trees
Younger than the mountains
Growing like a breeze

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads

All my memories
Gather 'round her
Miner's lady
Stranger to blue water

Dark and dusty
Painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine
Teardrop in my eye

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads

I hear her voice in the morning hour, she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
Driving down the road, I get a feeling
That I should have been home yesterday
Yesterday

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads

Take me home (down), country roads
Take me home (down), country roads
