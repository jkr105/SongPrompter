EVERYBODY HURTS


When the day is long
And the night, the night is yours alone
When you're sure you've had enough
Of this life
Well, hang on

Don't let yourself go
'Cause everybody cries
And everybody hurts
Sometimes

Sometimes everything is wrong
Now it's time to sing along

When your day is night alone (hold on, hold on)
If you feel like letting go (hold on)
If you think you've had too much
Of this life
Well, hang on

'Cause everybody hurts
Take comfort in your friends
And everybody hurts

Don't throw your hand
Oh, no
Don't throw your hand
If you feel like you're alone
No, no, no, you're not alone

If you're on your own in this life
The days and nights are long
When you think you've had too much
Of this life
To hang on

Well, everybody hurts
Sometimes, everybody cries
And everybody hurts
Sometimes

And everybody hurts
Sometimes
So, hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on

Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on

Everybody hurts
No, no, no, no, no
You're not alone
