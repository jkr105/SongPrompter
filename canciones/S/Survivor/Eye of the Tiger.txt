TÍTULO: Eye of the tiger

LETRA:

Risin’ up, back on the street… 
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I’m back on my feet 
just a man and his will to survive

So many times, it happens too fast… 
you change your passion for glory
Don’t lose your grip on the dreams of the past, 
you must fight just to keep them alive

It’s the eye of the tiger, it’s the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
And he’s watching us all with the eye… of the tiger

Face to face, out in the heat… 
hangin’ tough, stayin’ hungry
They stack the odds, still we take to the street, 
for we kill with the skill to survive
Risin’ up, straight to the top… 
had the guts, got the glory
Went the distance, now I’m not gonna stop, 
just a man and his will to survive
The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
