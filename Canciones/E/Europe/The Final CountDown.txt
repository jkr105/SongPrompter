TÍTULO: The final countdown

LETRA:

We’re leaving together… 
but still it’s farewell
And maybe we’ll come back, 
to Earth, who can tell?

I guess there is no one to blame, 
we’re leaving ground (leaving ground)
Will things ever be the same again?

It’s the final countdown…
The final countdown… Ooooh

We’re heading for Venus… 
and still we stand tall
Cause maybe they’ve seen us, 
and welcome us all

With so many light years to go, 
and things to be found (to be found)
I’m sure that we’ll all miss her so

It’s the final countdown…
The final countdown…
The final countdown…
The final countdown… Oh-ooh

It’s the final countdown…
The final countdown…
The final countdown…
