MARRY YOU


It's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey, baby
I think I wanna marry you

Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby?
I think I wanna marry you

Well, I know this little chapel
On the boulevard
We can go
No one will know
Oh, come on, girl

Who cares if we're trashed?
Got a pocket full of cash we can blow
Shots of Patron
And it's on, girl

Don't say no, no, no, no, no
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And we'll go, go, go, go, go
If you're ready, like I'm ready

'Cause it's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey, baby
I think I wanna marry you

Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby?
I think I wanna marry you, oh

I'll go get a ring
Let the choir bells sing like: Ooh
So what you wanna do?
Let's just run, girl

And if we wake up
And you wanna break up, that's cool
No, I won't blame you
It was fun, girl

Don't say no, no, no, no, no
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And we'll go, go, go, go, go
If you're ready, like I'm ready

'Cause it's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey, baby
I think I wanna marry you

Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby?
I think I wanna marry you

Just say: I do
Tell me right now, baby
Tell me right now, baby, baby
Just say: I do
Tell me right now, baby
Tell me right now, baby, baby, oh

It's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey, baby
I think I wanna marry you

Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby?
I think I wanna marry you
