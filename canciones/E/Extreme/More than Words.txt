TÍTULO: MORE THAN WORDS

Saying I love you, is not the words
I want to hear from you
It´s not that I want you
not to say but if you only knew

How easy it would be to show me how you feel
More than words is all you have to do to make it real
then you wouldn´t have to say that you love me
´cause I´d already know.

What would you do if my heart was torn in two?
More than words to show you feel that your love for me is real
What would you say if I took these words away?
then you couldn´t make things new just by saying "I love you"

Now that I´ve tried to
talk to you and make you understand,
all you have to do
is close your eyes and just reach out your hands

and touch me. Hold me close don´t ever let me go.
More than words is all I ever needed you to show
then you wouldn´t have to say that you love me
´cause I´d already know
