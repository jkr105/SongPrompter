TÍTULO: Hey Jude

LETRA:
Hey Jude, don’t make it bad, 
take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart, 
then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don’t be afraid, 
you were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin, 
then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don’t carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it’s a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

Hey Jude, don’t make it bad, 
take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin, 
then you begin to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You’re waiting for someone to perform with
And don’t you know that it’s just you, 
hey Jude, you’ll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

Hey Jude, don’t make it bad, 
take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin, 
then you begin to make it better
Better, better, better, better…

Naah nah nah nah nah nah naaah nah nah nah naaah, 

hey Jude
