OH SUSANA


Oh I come from Alabama
with a banjo on my knee,
I'm going to Louisiana,
my true love for to see

It rained all night the day I left, 
the weather it was dry 
The sun so hot I froze to death; 
Susanna, don't you cry.

Oh, Susanna,
don't you cry for me
For I come from Alabama,
With my banjo on my knee.

I had a dream the other night 
when everything was still, 
I thought I saw Susanna 
coming up the hill,

The buckwheat cake was in her mouth, 
the tear was in her eye, 
I said I'm coming from the south, 
Susanna don't you cry.

Oh, Susanna,
don't you cry for me
For I come from Alabama,
With my banjo on my knee.

I soon will be in New Orleans 
And then I'll look around 
And when I find Susanna, 
I'll fall upon the ground. 

But if I do not find her, 
then I will surely die, 
and when I'm dead and buried, 
Susanna don't you cry.

Oh, Susanna,
don't you cry for me
For I come from Alabama,
With my banjo on my knee.

Para tomar unas fotos 
yo te voy a recoger 
y al abrir la puerta y verme 
la cerraste otra vez

Oh Su-sa-na
no te rías de mi
y no le cuentes a nadie
cómo me has visto venir.
