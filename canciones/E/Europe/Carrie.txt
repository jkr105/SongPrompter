CARRIE


When lights go down
I see no reason for you to cry
We've been through this before
In every time, in every season
God knows I've tried
So, please, don't ask for more

Can't you see it in my eyes?
That this might be our last goodbye

Carrie! Carrie!
Things, they change, my friend (woah-oh)
Carrie! Carrie!
Maybe we'll meet again
Somewhere again

I read your mind
With no intentions of being unkind
I wish I could explain
It all takes time, a whole lot of patience
If it's a crime, how come I feel no pain?

Can't you see it in my eyes?
That this might be our last goodbye

Carrie! Carrie!
Oh, things, they change, my friend (woah-oh)
Carrie! Carrie!
Maybe we'll meet again

Oh-oh
Can't you see it in my eyes?
That this might be our last goodbye

(Oh-oh-oh) oh
Carrie! Carrie!
Oh-oh, things, they change (woah-oh)
Carrie, Carrie, Carrie
Carrie! Carrie!
Maybe we'll meet again
Oh, somewhere again

When lights go down
