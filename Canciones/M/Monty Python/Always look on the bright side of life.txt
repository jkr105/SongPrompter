TÍTULO: Always look on the bright side of life

LETRA:

Some things in life are bad, 
they can really make you mad
Other things just make you swear and curse

When you are chewing on life’s gristle
Don’t grumble give a whistle… 
and this’ll help things turn out for the best and

Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life

If life seems jolly rotten, 
there’s something you’ve forgotten
And that’s to laugh and smile and dance and sing

When you’re feeling in the dumps 
don’t be silly chumps
Just purse your lips and whistle that’s the thing and

Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life

For life is quite absurd, 
and death’s the final word
You must always face the curtain with a bow!

Forget about your sin… give the audience a grin,
Enjoy it, it’s the last chance anyhow!

Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life

Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life
