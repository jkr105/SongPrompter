TÍTULO: I don’t like mondays

LETRA:

The silicon chip inside her head
Gets switched to overload

And nobody's gonna go to school today
She's gonna make them stay at home

And daddy doesn't understand it
He always said she was good as gold
And he can see no reasons
Cos there are no reasons
What reason do you need to be shown

Tell me why I don't like mondays
Tell me why I don't like mondays
Tell me why I don't like mondays
I wanna shoo-oo-oo-oo - oo - oot

The whole day down
The Telex machine is kept so clean

And it types to a waiting world
And Mother feels so shocked, Father's world is rocked

And their thoughts turn to their own little girl
Sweet sixteen ain't that peachy keen
No it ain't so neat to admit defeat

They can see no reasons
Cos there are no reasons
What reason do you need

Tell me why I don't like mondays
Tell me why I don't like mondays
Tell me why I don't like mondays
I wanna shoo-oo-oo-oo - oo - oot

And all the playing's stopped in the playground now
She wants to play with her toys a while
And school's out early and soon we'll be learning
And the lesson today is how to die

And then the bullhorn crackles, And the captain tackles
With the problems and the how's and why's
And he can see no reasons
Cos there are no reasons
What reason do you need to die

Tell me why I don't like mondays
Tell me why I don't like mondays
Tell me why I don't like mondays
I wanna shoo-oo-oo-oo - oo - oot
