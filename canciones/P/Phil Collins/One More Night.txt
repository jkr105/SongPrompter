ONE MORE NIGHT



One more night
One more night

I've been trying, ooh, so long
To let you know
Let you know how I feel
And if I stumble or if I fall
Just help me back
So I can make you see

Please give me one more night
Give me one more night
One more night
'Cause I can't wait forever (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Give me just one more night
Ooh, just one more night
Oh, one more night
'Cause I can't wait forever (ooh, ooh, ooh)

I've been sitting here so long
Wasting time
Just staring at the phone
And I was wondering, should I call you?
Then I thought
Maybe you're not alone

Please give me one more night
Give me just one more night
Oh, one more night
'Cause I can't wait forever (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Please give me one more night
Ooh, just one more night
Oh, one more night
'Cause I can't wait forever (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Give me one more night
Give me just one more night
Ooh, one more night
'Cause I can't wait forever (ooh, ooh, ooh)

Like a river to the sea, I will always be with you
And if you sail away, I will follow you

Give me one more night
Give me just one more night
Oh, one more night
'Cause I can't wait forever (ooh, ooh, ooh)

I know there'll never be a time
You'll ever feel the same
And I know it's only words
But if you change your mind
You know that I'll be here
And maybe we both can learn

Give me just one more night
Give me just one more night
Ooh, one more night
'Cause I can't wait forever (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Give me just one more night
Give me just one more night
Ooh, one more night
'Cause I can't wait forever (ooh, ooh, ooh)
