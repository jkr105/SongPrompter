TÍTULO: Something stupid

LETRA:
I know I stand in line until you think to spend an evening with me
And if we go someplace to dance
I know that there’s a chance you won’t be leaving with me
And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place and have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like I love you

I can see it in your eyes that you despise
The same old lines you heard the night before
And though it’s just a line to you for me it’s true and never seemed so right before
I practice every day to find some clever lines
To say to make the meaning come true
But then I think I’ll wait until the evening gets late and I’m alone with you

The time is right you perfume fills my head
The stars get red and on the nights so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like I love you
The time is right you perfume fills my head
The stars get red and on the nights so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
