TÍTULO: Take on me

LETRA:

Talking away… I don’t know what I’m to say
I’ll say it anyway… today’s another day to find you
Shyin’ away, I’ll be coming for your love, OK?

Take on me… (Take on me)
Take me on… (Take on me)
I’ll be gone… in a day or two

So, needless to say… I’m odds and ends, but I’ll be
Stumbling awake… slowly learning that life is OK
Say after me, it’s no better to be safe than sorry

Take on me… (Take on me)
Take me on… (Take on me)
I’ll be gone… in a day or two

Oh, things that you say… yeah is it life or just to play
My worries away… you’re all the things I’ve got to remember
You are shying away, I’ll be coming for you anyway

Take on me… (Take on me)
Take me on… (Take on me)
I’ll be gone… in a day or two

Take on me… (Take on me)
Take me on… (Take on me)
I’ll be gone… in a day or two
