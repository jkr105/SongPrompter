DON'T WRITE ME OFF


It's never been easy for me
To find words to go along with a melody
But this time there's actually something on my mind
So please forgive these few brief awkward lines
Since I met you my whole life has changed
It's not just my furniture you've re-arranged
I was living in the past
But somehow you've brought me back
And I haven't felt like this since before Frankie said relax
And now I know based on my track record
I might not seem like the safest bet
All I'm asking you is
Don't write me off just yet

For years I've been telling myself the same old story
That I'm happy to live off my so called former glories
But you've given me a reason
To take another chance
Now I need you despite the fact
That you've killed all my plants
And now I know
I've already blown more chances
Than anyone should ever get
All I'm asking you is
Don't write me off just yet
Don't write me off just yet
