TÍTULO: California dreaming

LETRA:
All the leaves are brown … 
And the sky is grey

I’ve been for a walk … 
On a winter’s day
I’d be safe and warm … 
If I was in L.A.
California dreaming … 
On such a winter’s day

Stepped into a church … 
I passed along the way
Oh I got down on my knees … 
And I pretend to pray

You know the preacher likes the cold … 
He knows I’m gonna stay
California dreaming … 
on such a winter’s day

All the leaves are brown … 
And the sky is grey
I’ve been for a walk … 
On a winter’s day
I’d be safe and warm … 
If I was in L.A.
California dreaming … 
On such a winter’s day
