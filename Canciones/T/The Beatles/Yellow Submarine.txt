T√çTULO: Yellow submarine

LETRA:
In the town where I was born lived a man who sailed the sea
And he told us of his life in the land of submarines
So we sailed up to the sun till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves in our yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow submarine, yellow submarine
And our friends were all on board, many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play
We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow submarine, yellow submarine
