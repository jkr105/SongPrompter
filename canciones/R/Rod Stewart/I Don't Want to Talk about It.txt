I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT


I can tell by your eyes
That you've probably been crying forever
And the stars in the sky don't mean nothing
To you, they're a mirror

I don't wanna talk about it
How you broke my heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart?
Oh, my heart

If I stand all alone
Will the shadows hide the colors of my heart?
Blue for the tears, black for the night's fears
The stars in the sky don't mean nothing
To you, they're a mirror

I don't wanna talk about it
How you broke my heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart?
Oh, my heart

I don't wanna talk about it
How you broke this old heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart?
Oh, my heart
My heart
Oh, my heart
