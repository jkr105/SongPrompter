I Want To Know What Love Is

I gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older
Oh, whoa

Now, this mountain I must climb
Feels like the world upon my shoulders
Through the clouds, I see love shine
It keeps me warm as life grows colder

In my life
There's been heartache and pain
I don't know
If I can face it again
Can't stop now
I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me
Oh, woah

I'm gonna take a little time
A little time to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide
It looks like love has finally found me

In my life
There's been heartache and pain
I don't know
If I can face it again
Can't stop now
I've travelled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me (and I wanna feel)
I wanna feel what love is (and I know)
I know you can show me

Let's talk about love (I wanna know what love is)
The love that you feel inside (I want you to show me)
I'm feeling so much love (I wanna feel what love is)
No, you just cannot hide (I know you can show me)
Yeah, woah

(I wanna know what love is) let's talk about love
(I want you to show me) I wanna feel it
(I wanna feel what love is) oh, I wanna feel it too
And I know, and I know
(I know you can show me) show me love is real
Yeah, yeah

(I wanna know what love is) yeah, I wanna know, oh
(I want you to show me) I wanna know
I wanna know, wanna know
(I wanna feel what love is) yeah, I wanna feel
I know you can show me, yeah
