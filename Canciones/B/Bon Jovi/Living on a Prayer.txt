TÍTULO: Livin’ on a prayer

LETRA:

Once upon a time, not so long ago
Tommy used to work on the docks
Union’s been on strike, he’s down on his luck, 
it’s tough… so tough

Gina works the diner all day
Working for her man, 
she brings home her pay for love… for love

She says we’ve got to hold on 
to what we’ve got
‘Cause it doesn’t make a difference if we make it or not
We’ve got each other 
and that’s a lot for love… 
we’ll give it a shot

Whooah, we’re half way there… 
Whooah, livin’ on a prayer
Take my hand and we’ll make it I swear… 
Whooah, livin’ on a prayer

Tommy’s got his six string in hock
Now he’s holding in what he used to make it talk, 
so tough… it’s tough
Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night, 
Tommy whispers: “Baby it’s okay… someday”
Livin’ on a prayer…

We’ve got to hold on, ready or not
You live for the fight when that’s all that you’ve got

Whooah, we’re half way there… 
Whooah, livin’ on a prayer
Take my hand and we’ll make it I swear… 
Whooah, livin’ on a prayer

Whooah, we’re half way there… 
Whooah, livin’ on a prayer
Take my hand and we’ll make it I swear… 
Whooah, livin’ on a prayer
