TÍTULO: What’s up

LETRA:

Twenty-five years and my life is still
Trying to get up that great big hill of hope for a destination

I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made of this brotherhood of man, for whatever that means

And so I cry sometimes when I’m lying in bed
Just to get it all out, what’s in my head and I… I am feeling a little peculiar

And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high and I scream at the top of my lungs:
“What’s going on?”

And I said “heyheyheyhey heyheyhey” I said “hey, what’s going on?”
And I said “heyheyheyhey heyheyhey” I said “hey, what’s going on?”
Oooh, oooh oooooooh… Oooh, oooh oooooooh

And I try, oh my God do I try… I tray all the time in this institution
And I pray, oh my God do I pray… I pray every single day for a revolution

And so I cry sometimes when I’m lying in bed
Just to get it all out, what’s in my head and I… I am feeling a little peculiar

And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high and I scream at the top of my lungs:
“What’s going on?”

And I said “heyheyheyhey heyheyhey” I said “hey, what’s going on?”
And I said “heyheyheyhey heyheyhey” I said “hey, what’s going on?”
Oooh, oooh oooooooh…

Twenty-five years and my life is still
Trying to get up that great big hill of hope for a destination
