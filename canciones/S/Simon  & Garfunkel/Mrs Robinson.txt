And here’s to you, Mrs. Robinson, 
Jesus loves you more than you will know… wo wo wo
God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson, 
Heaven holds a place for those who pray…
Hey hey hey… Hey hey hey

We’d like to know a little bit about you for our files
We’d like to help you learn to help yourself
Look around you all you see are sympathetic eyes…
Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home

Hide it in a hiding place where no one ever goes
Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes
It’s a little secret just the Robinsons’ affair
Most of all you’ve got to hide it from the kids

Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon
Going to the candidates’ debate
Laugh about it shout about it when you’ve got to choose
Any way you look at it, you lose

Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio, 
a nation turns its lonely eyes to you… wo wo wo
What’s that you say, Mrs. Robinson, 
Joltin’ Joe has left and gone away…
Hey hey hey… Hey hey hey
