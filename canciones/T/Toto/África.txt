TÍTULO: Africa

LETRA:

I hear drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversaaaation

She’s coming in, twelve-thirty flight
The moonlight wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvaaation

I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient meeeelodies

He turned to me as if to say, “Hurry boy, it’s waiting there for you”
It’s gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There’s nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Aaaaafrica
Gonna take some time to do the things we never haaaaad

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company

I know that I must do what’s right
Sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti

I seek to cure what’s deep inside, frightened of this thing that I’ve become
It’s gonna take a lot to take me away from you

There’s nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Aaaaafrica
I bless the rains down in Aaaaafrica
I bless the rains down in Aaaaafrica
I bless the rains down in Aaaaafrica
Gonna take some time to do the things we never haaaaad
