TÍTULO: Neverending Story

LETRA:

Turn around... 
look at what you see
In her face… the mirror of your dreams

Make believe I’m everywhere, 
given in the lines
Written on the pages 
is the answer to a neverending story 
(aaah, aaah, aaah)

Reach the stars… 
Fly a fantasy
Dream a dream… and what you see will be
Rhymes that keep their secrets 
will unfold behind the clouds
And there upon the rainbow 
is the answer to a neverending story 
(aaah, aaah, aaah)

Story… (aaah, aaah, aaah)

Show no fear… for she may fade away
In your hands… the birth of a new day
Rhymes that keep their secrets 
will unfold behind the clouds
And there upon the rainbow 
is the answer to a neverending story 
(aaah, aaah, aaah)

Neverending story… (aaah, aaah, aaah)
Neverending story… (aaah, aaah, aaah)
