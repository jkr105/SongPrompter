T√çTULO: LOVE IS ALL AROUND

LETRA:

I feel it in my fingers, I feel it in my toes
love is all around me, and so the feeling grows
It's written on the wind, it's everywhere I go
So if you really love me, come on and let it show

You know I love you, I always will
My mind's made up by the way that I feel
There's no beginning, there'll be no end
'cause on my love you can depend

I see your face before me as I lay on my bed
I kinda get to thinking of all the things you said
You gave your promise to me and I gave mine to you
I need someone beside me in everything I do

It's written on the wind, it's everywhere I go
So if you really love me, come on and let it show

Come on let it show, Come on let it show
Come on let it show, Come on let it show
Come on let it show, Come on let it show
Come on let it show, Come on let it show
Come on let it show, Come on let it show
Come on let it show, Come on let it show
