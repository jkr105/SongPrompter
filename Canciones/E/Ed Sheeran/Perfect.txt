TÍTULO: Perfect

LETRA:

I found a love… for me… 
darling just dive right in, 
and follow my lead

Well, I found a girl… 
beautiful and sweet…
I never knew you were the someone 
waiting for me

Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was… 
I will not give you up this tiiiiiime

Darling just kiss me slow… 
your heart is all I own
And in your eyes 
you’re holding mine
Baby, I’m… dancing in the dark, 
with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass… 
listening to our favorite song
When you said you looked a mess… 
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, 
darling you look perfect tonight

Well, I found a woman… 
stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, 
I hope that someday I’ll share her hoooooome

I found a love… 
to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children 
of our own

We are still kids but we’re so in love… 
fighting against all odds
I know we’ll be alright this tiiiiiiiime
Darling just hold my hand… 
be my girl, I’ll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I’m… dancing in the dark, 
with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass… 
listening to our favorite song
When I saw you on that dress… 
looking so beautiful
I don’t deserve this, 
darling you look perfect tonight

Baby, I’m… dancing in the dark, 
with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass… 
listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see… 
now I know I have met an angel
In person… and she looks perfect
I don’t deserve this… 
you look perfect tonight
