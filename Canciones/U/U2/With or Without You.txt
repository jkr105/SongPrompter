TÍTULO: With or without you

LETRA:

See the stone set in your eyes… 
See the thorn twist in your side
And I’ll wait for you

Sleight of hand and twist of fate… 
On a bed of nails, she makes me wait
And I’ll wait, without you… 

With or without you, with or without you

Though the storm we reach the shore, 
you give it all but I want more
And I’ll wait for you

With or without you, with or without you 
I… I can’t live… with or without you

And you give yourself away, 
and you give yourself away
And you give, and you give, 
and you give yourself away

My hands are tied, my body bruised, 
she’s got me with
Nothing to win, and nothing left to lose
And you give yourself away, 
and you give yourself away
And you give, and you give, 
and you give yourself away

With or without you, with or without you 
I… I can’t live… with or without you
