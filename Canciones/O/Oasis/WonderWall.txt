TÍTULO: Wonderwall

LETRA:

Today is gonna be the day 
that they’re gonna throw it back to you
By now you should’ve somehow 
realized what you gotta do
I don’t believe that anybody 
feels the way I do about you now

Backbeat the word was on the street 
that the fire in your heart is out
I’m sure you’ve heard it all before 
but you never really had a doubt
I don’t believe that anybody feels 
the way I do about you now

And all the roads 
we have to walk along are winding
And all the lights 
that lead us there are blinding

There are many things that I would like 
to say to you but I don’t know how

Because maybe… 
you’re gonna be the one that saves me
And after all… you’re my wonderwall

And after all…

Because maybe… 
you’re gonna be the one that saves me
And after all… 
you’re my wonderwall

I said maybe… 
you’re gonna be the one that saves me
You’re gonna be the one that saves me
You’re gonna be the one that saves me
