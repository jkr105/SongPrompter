DON'T YOU (Forget about me)



Hey, hey, hey, hey
Ooh whoa

Won't you come see about me?
I'll be alone dancing, you know it, baby
Tell me your troubles and doubts
Giving me everything inside and out
And love's strange, so real in the dark
Think of the tender things
That we were working on
Slow change may pull us apart
When the light gets into your heart, baby

Don't you forget about me
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't you forget about me

Will you stand above me
Look my way, never love me
Rain keeps falling
Rain keeps falling
Down, down, down
Will you recognize me
Call my name or walk on by
Rain keeps falling
Rain keeps falling
Down, down, down, down

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Ooh whoa

Don't you try and pretend
It's my feeling
We'll win in the end
I won't harm you
Or touch your defenses
Vanity, insecurity

Don't you forget about me
I'll be alone dancing, you know it, baby
Going to take you apart
I'll build us back together at heart, baby

Don't you forget about me
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't you forget about me

As you walk on by
Will you call my name?
As you walk on by
Will you call my name?
When you walk away

Or will you walk away
Will you walk on by?
Come on, call my name
Will you call my name?

I say, la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
When you walk on by
And you call my name
When you walk on by
