TÍTULO: Imagine

LETRA:

Imagine there’s no heaven. 
It’s easy if you try

No hell below us. 
Above us only sky

Imagine all the people… 
living for today uuh uuh uuh

Imagine there’s no countries. 
It isn’t hard to do

Nothing to kill or die for. 
And no religion too

Imagine all the people… 
living life in peace ooh oooh oooh

You may say I’m a dreamer, 
but I’m not the only one

I hope someday you’ll join us, 
and the world will be as one

Imagine no possesions, 
I wonder if you can

No need to greed or hunger, 
a brotherhood of man

Imagine all the people… 
sharing al the world uuh uuh uuuuh

You may say I’m a dreamer, 
but I’m not the only one

I hope someday you’ll join us, 
and the world will be as one
