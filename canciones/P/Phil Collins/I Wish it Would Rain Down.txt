I WISH IT WOULD RAIN DOWN


You know I never meant to see you again
But I only passed by as a friend, yeah
All this time I stayed out of sight
I started wondering why

Now I-
Ooh, now I wish it would rain down, down on me
Ooh, yes, I wish it would rain, rain down on me now
Ooh, yes, I wish it would rain down, down on me
Ooh, yes, I wish it would rain on me

You said you didn't need me in your life
Oh, I guess you were right, yeah
Ooh, I never meant to cause you no pain
But it looks like I did it again, yeah

Now I-
Now I know I wish it would rain down, down on me
Ooh, yes, I wish it would rain, rain down on me now
Ooh, girl, I wish it would rain down, down on me
Ooh, yes, I wish it would rain on me

Though your hurt is gone
Mine's hanging on, inside
And I know
It's eating me through, it's eating me through every night and day
I'm just waiting on your sign
'Cause I know, I know
I never meant to cause you no pain
And I realize I let you down, oh, yeah
But I know in my heart of hearts
I know I'm never gonna hold you again, no

Now I-
Now I know I wish it would rain down, down on me
Ooh, you know I wish it would rain, rain down on me now
Ooh, yes, I wish it would rain down, down on me
Yes, you know I wish it would rain down, rain down over me
(Rain)

(Rain) just rain down over me
Just let it rain down, let it rain down
Let it rain down, oh, yeah

Let it rain down (rain)
(Rain) rain down over me

Just let it rain (rain) down, just let it rain (rain) down
Let it rain (rain) down

Just let it rain (rain)
