SOMEONE YOU LOVED

I'm going under and this time
I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way
Of driving me crazy

I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked
The way you numbed all the pain

Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used
To being someone you loved

I'm going under and this time
I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving
Got me sleeping without you

Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked
The way you helped me escape

Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used
To being someone you loved

And I tend to close my eyes
When it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound
Till I come back around

For now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used
To being someone you loved

But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used
To being someone you loved

I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used
To being someone you loved
