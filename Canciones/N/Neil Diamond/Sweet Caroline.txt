TÍTULO: Sweet Caroline

LETRA:

Where it began, I can’t begin to know it
But then I know it’s going strong
Was it the spring, and spring became a summer?
Who’d have believe you’d come along?
Hands, touching hands… reaching out, touching me, touching you

Sweet Caroline, good times never seemed so good

I’m inclined, to believe they never would… But now I’m
Look at the night, and it don’t seem so lonely
We fill it up with only two
And when I hurt, hurting runs off my shoulder
How can I hurt when holding you?
Hands, touching hands… reaching out, touching me, touching you

Sweet Caroline, good times never seemed so good
Sweet Caroline, to believe they never would… But now I’m
