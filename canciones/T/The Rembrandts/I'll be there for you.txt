TÍTULO: I’ll be there for you

LETRA:

So no one told you life 
was gonna be this way
Your job’s a joke, you’re broke, 
your love life’s DOA

It’s like you’re always stuck in second gear
And that it hasn’t been your day, 
your week your month
Or even your year but

I’ll be there for you 
[when the rain starts to pour]

I’ll be there for you 
[like I’ve been there before]

I’ll be there for you 
[cuz you’re there for me too]
