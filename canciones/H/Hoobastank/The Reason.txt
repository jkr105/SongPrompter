REASON, THE


I'm not a perfect person
There are many things I wish I didn't do
But I continue learning
I never meant to do those things to you
and so I have to say before I go

that I just want you to know
I've found a reason for me, 
to change who I used to be
a reason to start over new, 
and the reason is you

I'm sorry that I hurt you 
It's something I must live with everyday 
and all the pain I put you through 
I wish that I could take 
it all away and be the one who catches all your tears 

thats why I need you to hear
I've found a reason for me, 
to change who I used to be
a reason to start over new, 
and the reason is you

and the reason is you
and the reason is you
and the reason is you
I'm not a perfect person 
I never meant to do those things to you 
and so I have to say before 
I go that I just want you to know
I've found a reason for me, 
to change who I used to be
a reason to start over new, 
and the reason is you

I've found a reason to show 
a side of me you didn't know 
a reason for all that I do 
and the reason is you
