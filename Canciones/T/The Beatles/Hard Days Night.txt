TÍTULO: Hard day’s night

LETRA:

It’s been a hard day’s night, and I’ve been working like a dog
It’s been a hard day’s night, I should be sleeping link a log

But when I get home to you, I find the things that you do,
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day, to get you money to buy you things
And it’s worth it just to hear you say, you’re gonna give me everything

So why on earth should I moan, ‘cause when I get you alone
You know I’ll be oookay

When I’m home, everything seems to be right
When I’m home, feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

It’s been a hard day’s night, and I’ve been working like a dog
It’s been a hard day’s night, I should be sleeping link a log

But when I get home to you, I find the things that you do,
Will make me feel alright
You know I feel all right
You know I feel all right
