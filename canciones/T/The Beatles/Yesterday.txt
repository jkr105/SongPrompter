Yesterday (Lennon – Mc Cartney)



RE	   FA#  		          Sim       SOL
Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away.
	LA			  RE
Now it looks as though they’re here to stay.
     Sim   MI   SOL   RE
Oh, I believe in yesterday.


Suddenly, I’m not half the man I used to be.

There’s a shadow hanging over me.

Oh, yesterday came suddenly.

FA#     Sim LA SOL
Why she had to go?
	LA		       RE
I don’t know, she wouldn’t say.
FA#  Sim  LA    SOL
I said something wrong
	LA                 RE
Now I long for yesterday.


Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play,

Now I need a place to hide away.

Oh, I believe in yesterday.


Why she had to go?

I don’t know, she wouldn’t say.

I said something wrong

Now I long for yesterday.


Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play,

Now I need a place to hide away.

Oh, I believe in yesterday.
