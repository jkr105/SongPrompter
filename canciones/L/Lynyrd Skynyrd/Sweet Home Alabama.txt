TÍTULO: Sweet home Alabama

LETRA:

Big wheels keep on turning… 
Carry me home to see my kin
Singing songs about the south land… 
I miss Alabama once again 
and I think it’s a sin

Well I heard Mr Young sing about her… 
Well I heard old Neil put her down
Well I hope Neil Young’ll remember… 
A southern man don’t need him around, anyhow

Sweet home Alabama… 
where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama… 
Lord I’m coming home to you

In Birmingham they love the Gov’nor, boo-hoo-hoo… 
Now we all did what we could do
Now Watergate does not bother me… 
Does your conscience bother you

Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swappers… 
And they’ve been known to pick a song or two
Lord they get me off so much… 
They pick me up when I’m feeling blue, now how ‘bout you
