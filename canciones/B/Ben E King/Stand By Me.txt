TÍTULO: Stand by me

LETRA:

When the night has come and the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we see

No I won’t be afraid, no I won’t be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

So darling, darling, stand by me
Oh stand, by me
Oh stand, stand by me, stand by me

If the sky, that we look upon, should tumble and fall
And the mountains, should crumble, to the sea

I won’t cry, I won’t cry, no I won’t shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

So darling, darling, stand by me
Oh stand, by me
Oh stand, stand by me, stand by me

Whenever you’re in trouble won’t you stand by me
Oh stand, stand by me
Oh stand, stand by me, stand by me
