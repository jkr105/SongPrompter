TÍTULO: Help!

LETRA:

HELP! I need somebody… HELP! Not just anybody
HELP! You know I need someone HELP!

When I was younger so much younger than today
I never needed anybody’s help in any way

But now those days are gone I’m not so self-assured
Now I find I’ve changed my mind and opened up the doors

Help me if you can I’m feeling down… 
and I do appreciate you being round
Help me get my feet back on the ground… 
won’t you please, please help me

And now my life has changed in oh, so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze

But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I’ve never done before

Help me if you can I’m feeling down… 
and I do appreciate you being round
Help me get my feet back on the ground… 
won’t you please, please help me

When I was younger so much younger than today
I never needed anybody’s help in any way

But now those days are gone I’m not so self-assured
Now I find I’ve changed my mind and opened up the doors

Help me if you can I’m feeling down… 
and I do appreciate you being round
Help me get my feet back on the ground… 
won’t you please, please help me
Help me, help me, ooh
