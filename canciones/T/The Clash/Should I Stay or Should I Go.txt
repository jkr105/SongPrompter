TÍTULO: Should I stay or should I go

LETRA:

Darlin’ you got to let me know
Should I stay or should I go?

If you say that you are mine
I’ll be here ‘til the end of time

So you got to let me kno-o-o-w
Should I stay or should I go?

Should I stay or should I go now?
Should I stay or should I go now?
If I go there will be trouble
If I stay it will be double
So come on and let me kno-o-o-w
Should I stay or should I go?
