I don’t like Mondays

The silicon chip inside her head gets switched to overload
And nobody's gonna go to school today
She's gonna make them stay at home
And daddy doesn't understand it
He always said she was good as gold
And he can see no reasons / 'Cause there are no reasons
What reason do you need to be shown?
I don't like Mondays (Tell me why)
I don't like Mondays (Tell me why)
I don't like Mondays - I wanna shoot the whole day down
The Telex machine is kept so clean And it types to a waiting world
Her mother feels so shocked, father's world is rocked
And their thoughts turn to their own little girl
Sweet sixteen, ain't that peachy keen
Now it ain't so neat to admit defeat
They can see no reasons / 'Cause there are no reasons
What reasons do you need, oh oh oh oh?
I don't like Mondays (Tell me why)…
Down, down, shoot it all down
And all the playing's stopped in the playground now
She wants to play with the toys a while
And school's out early and soon we be learning
And the lesson today is how to die
And then the bullhorn crackles and the captain tackles
With the problems and the hows and whys
And he can see no reasons / 'Cause there are no reasons
What reason do you need to die, die, oh oh oh?
The silicon chip inside her head Gets switched to overload
And nobody's gonna go to school today 
She's gonna make them stay at home
And daddy doesn't understand it
He always said she was good as gold
And he can see no reasons / 'Cause there are no reasons
What reason do you need to be shown? 
I don't like Mondays (Tell me why)… 
I wanna shoot the whole day down
