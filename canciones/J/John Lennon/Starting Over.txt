TÍTULO: (Just like) Starting over

LETRA:

Our life, together, is so precious, together
We have grown… we have grown

Although our love, is still special
Let’s take a chance and fly away, somewhere alone
It’s been too long since we took the time,
No one’s to blame. I know time flies so quickly

But, when I see you darlin’, 
it’s like we both are fallin’ 
in love, again, it’ll be
Just like starting over… Starting over

Every day we used to make it, love.
Why can’t we be makin’ love, nice and easy?
It’s time to spread our wings and fly. 
Don’t let another day go by, my love, it’ll be
Just like starting over… Starting over

Why don’t we take off alone… 
take a trip somewhere far, far away
We’ll be together all alone, again,
Like we used to be in the early days. Well, well darlin’
It’s been too long since we took the time,
No one’s to blame. I know time flies so quickly
But, when I see you darlin’, 
it’s like we both are fallin’ 
in love, again, it’ll be
Just like starting over… Starting over

Our life, together, is so precious, together
We have grown… we have grown
Although our love, is still special
Let’s take a chance and fly away, somewhere alone
