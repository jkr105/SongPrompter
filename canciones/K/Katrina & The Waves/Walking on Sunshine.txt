TÍTULO: Walking on sunshine

LETRA:

I used to think maybe you love me, 
now baby I’m sure
And I just can’t wait till the day 
when you knock on my door
Now every time I go for the mailbox 
gotta hold myself down
Cuz I just can’t wait till you write me 
you’re comin’ around
And I’m walking on sunshine… whoah!!

I’m walking on sunshine… whoah!!
I’m walking on sunshine… whoah!!

And don’t it feel good? Hey! Alright now!
And don’t it feel good? Hey! Yeah!

I used to think maybe you love me, 
now I know that it’s true
And I don’t want to spend my whole life 
just waiting for you
Now I don’t want you back for the weekend, 
not back for a day, no no no
I said baby I just want you back, 
and I want you to stay
