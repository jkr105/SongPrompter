WORDS

Words don't come easy to me
How can I find a way
To make you see
I love you
Words don't come easy

Words, don't come easy to me
This is the only way
For me to say
I love you
Words don't come easy

Well I'm just a music man
Melodies, so far my best friend
But my words are coming out wrong, girl, I
I reveal my heart to you and
Hope that you'll believe it's true, 'cause

Words, don't come easy to me
How can I find a way
To make you see
I love you
Words don't come easy

This is just a simple song
That I've made for you on my own
There's no hidden meaning, you know when I
When I say I love you honey
Please believe I really do, 'cause

Words, don't come easy to me
How can I find a way
To make you see
I love you
Words don't come easy

It isn't easy
Words don't come easy

Words don't come easy to me
How can I find a way
To make you see
I love you
Words don't come easy

Don't come easy to me
This is the only way
For me to say
I love you
Words don't come easy
