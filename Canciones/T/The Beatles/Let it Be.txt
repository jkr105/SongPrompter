Let it be (Lennon-Mc Cartney)



	 DO                SOL
When I find myself in times of trouble,
Lam               FA
Mother Mary comes to me
DO                        SOL              FA   DO
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.


And in my hour of darkness

she is standing right in front of me

Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.

        Lam       SOL      FA         DO
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be,
                               SOL            FA   DO
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.


And when the broken hearted people
living in the world agree,
There will be an answer, let it be.

For though they may be parted there is
still a change that they will see.
There will be an answer, let it be.


Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be,

There will be an aswer, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be,

Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.


And when the night is cloudy, there is
still a light that shines on me.
Shine until tomorrow, let it be.

I wake off to the saound of music,
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.


Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be,

There will be an aswer, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be,

Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.
