TÍTULO: I still haven’t found what I’m looking for

LETRA:

I have climbed highest mountains… 
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you, only to be with you

I have run, I have crawled… I have scaled these city walls
These city walls, only to be with you

But I still haven’t found what I’m looking for
But I still haven’t found what I’m looking for

I have kissed honey lips… 
felt the healing in her fingertips
It burned like fire, this burning desire

I have spoken with the tongue of angels… 
I have held the hand of the devil
It was warm in the night, I was cold as a stone

But I still haven’t found what I’m looking for
But I still haven’t found what I’m looking for

I believe in the kingdom come… 
Then all the colors they will bleed into one
Bleed into one, but yes I’m still running

You broke the bonds and you loosed the chains… 
carried the cross of my shame
Of my shame, you know I believe it

But I still haven’t found what I’m looking for
But I still haven’t found what I’m looking for

But I still haven’t found what I’m looking for
But I still haven’t found what I’m looking for
