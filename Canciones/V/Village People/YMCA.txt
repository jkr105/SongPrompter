TÍTULO: YMCA

LETRA:

Young man… 
there’s no need to feel down, I said
Young man… 
pick yourself off the ground, I said
Young man… 
‘cause you’re in a new town
There’s no need… to… be… unhappy

Young man… 
there’s a place you can go, I said
Young man… 
when you’re short on your dough, you can
Stay there… 
and I’m sure you will find
Many ways… to… have… a… good… time

It’s fun to stay at the YMCA! 
It’s fun to stay at the YMCA
They have everything for you men to enjoy
You can hang out with all the boys

It’s fun to stay at the YMCA! 
It’s fun to stay at the YMCA
You can get yourself cleaned, 
you can have a good meal
You can do whatever you feel

Young man… 
are you listening to me, I said
Young man… 
what do you want to be, I said
Young man… 
you can make real your dreams
But you’ve got… to… know… this… one… thing

No man… 
does it all by himself, I said
Young man… 
put your pride on the shelf and just
Go there… 
to the YMCA
I’m sure they… can… help… you… today

Young man… 
I was once in your shoes, I said
I was… 
down and out with the blues, I felt
No man… 
cared if I were alive
I felt the… whole… world… was… so… tight
That’s when… someone came up to me and said

Young man… 
take a walk up the street, there’s a
Place there… 
called the YMCA
They can start… you… back… on… your… way
