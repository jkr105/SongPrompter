THE WHOLE ON THE MOON

I pictured a rainbow
You held it in your hands
I had flashes but you saw the plan
I wondered out in the world for years
While you just stayed in your room
I saw the crescent
You saw the whole of the Moon
The whole of the Moon

You were there at the turnstiles
With the wind at your heels
You stretched for the stars
And you know how it feels
To reach too high
Too far, too soon
You saw the whole of the Moon

I was grounded
While you filled the skies
I was dumbfounded by truths
You cut through lies
I saw the rain-dirty valley
You saw Brigadoon
I saw the crescent
You saw the whole of the Moon

I spoke about wings
You just flew
I wondered, I guessed when I tried
You just knew
I sighed but you swooned
I saw the crescent
You saw the whole of the Moon
The whole of the Moon

With a torch in your pocket
And the wind at your heels
You climbed on the ladder
And you know how it feels
To get too high
Too far, too soon
You saw the whole of the Moon
The whole of the Moon

Unicorns and cannonballs
Palaces and piers
Trumpets, towers and tenements
Wide oceans full of tears
Flag, rags, ferry boats
Scimitars and scarves
Every precious dream and vision
Underneath the stars

Yes, you climbed on the ladder
With the wind in your sails
You came like a comet
Blazing your trail
Too high, too far, too soon
You saw the whole of the Moon
