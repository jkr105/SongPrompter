The Fool on the Hill

Day after day, alone on a Hill,
the man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him, they can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer but the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down and the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way, head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice but the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him, they can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings but the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head See the world spinning round

Ohh oh-oh-oh-oh ohh-oh-oh
Round and round and round and round and round

He never listens to them, He knows that they're the fool
They don't like him, The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down and the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Ohhhh
Round and round and round and round and
Ohhhh
