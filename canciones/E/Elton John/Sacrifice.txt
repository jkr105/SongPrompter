Sacrifice (Elton John)

It’s a human sign when things go wrong,
When the scent of her lingers and temptation’s strong.
In to the boundary of each married man,
Sweet deceipt comes a callin’ and negativity lands.

Cold, cold heart, hard done by you
Some things look better, baby just passin’ through.
And it’s no sacrifice, just a simple word,
It’s two hearts living in two separated worlds.
But it’s no sacrifice, no sacrifice,
No sacrifice at all.

Mutual misunderstanding after the fact.
Sensitivity bulds a prison in the final act.
We loose direction, no stone unturned,
No tears to damn you when jeaulosy burns.

Cold, cold heart, hard done by you
Some things look better, baby just passin’ through.
And it’s no sacrifice, just a simple word,
It’s two hearts living in two separated worlds.
But it’s no sacrifice, no sacrifice,
No sacrifice at all.

No sacrifice at all.
No sacrifice at all.

No sacrifice at all.
No sacrifice at all.

It’s no sacrifice at all.
