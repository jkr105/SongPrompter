TÍTULO: Moonlight shadow

LETRA:

The last that ever she saw him, carried away by a moonlight shadow
He passed on worried and warning, carried away by a moonlight shadow

Lost in a riddle last Saturday night, far away on the other side
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
And she couldn’t find how to push through

The trees that whisper in the evening, carried away by a moonlight shadow
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving, carried away by a moonlight shadow
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun far away on the other side
He was shot six times by a man on the run, and she couldn’t find how to push through

I stay… I pray… I see you in heaven far away
I stay… I pray… I see you in heaven one day

Four a.m. in the morning, carried away by a moonlight shadow
I watched your vision forming, carried away by a moonlight shadow

Star was light in a silvery night far away on the other side
Will you come to talk to me this night, but she couldn’t find how to push through
Caught in the middle of a hundred and five

The night was heavy but the air was alive, she couldn’t find how to push through
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Far away on the other side
