TÍTULO: Hound dog

LETRA:
You ain’t nothin’ but a hound dog… 
cryin’ all the time
You ain’t nothin’ but a hound dog… 
cryin’ all the time
Well you ain’t never caught a rabbit 
and you ain’t no friend of mine

Well they said you was high-classed… 
well, that was just a lie
Well they said you was high-classed… 
well, that was just a lie
Well you ain’t never caught a rabbit 
and you ain’t no friend of mine

You ain’t nothin’ but a hound dog… 
cryin’ all the time
You ain’t nothin’ but a hound dog… 
cryin’ all the time

Well you ain’t never caught a rabbit 
and you ain’t no friend of mine
