TÍTULO: It must have been love

LETRA:

Lay a whisper on my pillow, 
leave a winter on the ground
I wake up lonely, there’s air of silence 
in the bedroom and all around
Touch me now, I close my eyes and dream away

It must have been love, but it’s over now
It must have been good but I lost it somehow
It must have been love, but it’s over now
From the moment we touched till the time had run out

Make-believing, we’re together 
that I’m sheltered by your heart
But in and outside I’ve turned to water 
like a teardrop in your palm
And it’s a hard, winter’s day, 
I dream away

It must have been love, but it’s over now
It was all that I wanted, now I’m living without
It must have been love, but it’s over now
It’s where the water flows, it’s where the wind blows, 
I’m not sure about end part

It must have been love, but it’s over now
It must have been good but I lost it somehow
It must have been love, but it’s over now
From the moment we touched till the time had run out

Yeah it must have been love, but it’s over now
It was all that I wanted, now I’m living without
It must have been love, but it’s over now
It’s where the water flows, it’s where the wind blows…
