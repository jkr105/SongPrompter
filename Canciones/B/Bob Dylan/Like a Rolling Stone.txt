TÍTULO: Like a rolling stone

LETRA:

Once upon a time you dressed so fine
You threw the bums a dime in your prime… didn’t you?

People’d call, say, “Beware Doll!
You’re bound to fall” you thought they were all just… kidding you!

You used to laugh about everybody that was hangin’ out
Now you don’t talk so loud
Now you don’t seem so proud
About having to be scrounging for your next meal!

How does it feel! How does it feel?
To be on you own? With no direction home?
Like a complete unknown! Like a rolling stone?

You’ve gone to the finest school. All right! “Miss Lonely”
But you know you only used to get… juiced in it
And nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street
And now you find out you’re gonna have to get… used to it!

You said you’d never compromise with the mystery tramp, but now you realize!
He’s not selling any… alibis…
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say “do you wanna make a deal?”
How does it feel! How does it feel?
To be on you own? With no direction home?
Like a complete unknown! Like a rolling stone?
